### Introduction

Coding standards is a very important problematic in today software development teams and companies. It is mandatory in large organizations to have an unified way of coding
and ensure everyone can understand and work on code written by others. This page will cover the advantages of having coding standards in a team, how to put coding standards
in place, and how coding standards can affect and improve the work and the efficiency of the developers.


### Why introduce coding standards

Introducing coding guidelines and standards has become mandaory in todays large organizations. The two main reasons are that it ensures the security and the performance of the code.
Having a whole team of developers coding their own way without taking into consideration the specifics of the project or the system that it's going to work on can cause
critical security issues that are going to be hard and fastidious to fix.
Coding standards allow the code to be less complex, easier to understand rapidly by those who didn't wrote it.
It also allows the solution to be updated much faster since it reduces the compatibility issues between one piece of code and another. The developers will know the structure of the
code they are working on and they will save time on finding how to adapt themselves.
Another great advantage of having coding standards is the easy bug fixing. A desorganized and wild code will cause a lot of useless reserach and work to fix the smallest bug.
Having a well organized code will allow developers to identify the source of the problem fastly, and to fix it without having to redevelop the whole part.

Coding standards are today a very common practice in organizations, but it can take time to be fully accepted by developers. One of the main problems introducing
coding standards is the disagreements about the rules and the guidelines that are getting adopted.
There is a lot of viable ways of doing things in every coding language, and each developer may have his vision on how to do them, that leads to reticence to adopt new guidelines. 
Making them do things as the organization decided is a real challenge, and requires efforts by the developer to adapt his standards. That can be supported by automated tools.

### Automated code formatting

Implementing coding standards has become that important for companies that some of them developed automatisation tools that ensure of the respect of the guidelines. Usually coding
standards are mostly related to formatting and typography matters, like the amount of spaces or indentations at the beggining of the lines, or the position of the brackets.
Each coding language has a lot of code formatters that can help a developer format his code, or check if it respects the standards that have been input. The best practice
is to have an automated tool that checks automatically the new code at every commit in the repository, and that send a report to the team on how well the code is formatted and 
how well it respects the guidelines. For example if the technology used is .NET, Team Foundation Server allow the organization to setup a checker that automatically checks the code,
highlighting to potential errors that have been made in term of coding standard, but also regarding the quality of the code, potential security breachs, and it gives recommendations
on how to fix it.
