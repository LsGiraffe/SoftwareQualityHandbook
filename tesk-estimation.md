### Introduction

Task estimation in scrum agile projects in a crucial part of the developement process, that assign to every task previously created her estimated difficulty, which gives an indication on how much time the task required to be done and who should do the task. Task estimation is usually done with the whole development team as it requires everyone to agree on the estimation.

### Techniques estimating tasks

There are several techniques that teams can use to estimate the difficulty of the tasks. The most popular one is the planning poker. The planning poker is a meeting where all the
members of the team are reunited to estimate togtether the tasks. Each task is passed on the table and everyone must say a number that correspond to how much he thinks the task
is complicated. The team has to come to an agreement based on what everyone answered and on the discussion they had about it.

### How to estimate efficiently

Whatever the used technique to estimate, to be the most accurate possible, the members should ask themselves a few questions that are going to help them understand the task more 
deeply :
* Design: What is the prior and mandatory knowledge that we should have before starting to work on it ?
* Coding: How much coding is required for implementing this user story. Have we come across any similar user story previously ?
* Unit Testing: Are any mock objects required for doing unit testing for this user story ?
* Integration Testing: Does this story impact the other functionalities of the same module and other modules also ?
* Acceptance Testing: What are the points to be taken care to deliver the desired product as desired by the Customers ?
* Expertise: Does any of the participants have done similar story before and is an expert in it ?
